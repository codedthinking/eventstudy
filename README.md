title: EVENTBASELINE - Correct Event Study After XTHDIDREGRESS
description: |
    `eventbaseline` transforms the coefficients estimated by `xthdidregress` into a correct event study relative to a baseline. The reported coefficients are the average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) for each period relative to the baseline. The baseline can be either a period before the treatment or the average of the pre-treatment periods.

# `eventbaseline` Correct event study after `xthdidregress`

# Syntax

- `eventbaseline`, [**pre**(#) **post**(#) **baseline**(*string*) **graph** **generate**(*name*)]

`eventbaseline` transforms the coefficients estimated by `xthdidregress` into a correct event study relative to a baseline. The reported coefficients are the average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) for each period relative to the baseline. The baseline can be either a period before the treatment or the average of the pre-treatment periods.


The package can be installed with
```
net install eventbaseline, from(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedthinking/eventbaseline/main/)
```

If you require a specific version, use
```
net install eventbaseline, from(https://github.com/korenmiklos/codedthinking/eventbaseline/raw/v0.7.0/)
```

# Options
## Options
Option | Description
-------|------------
**pre** | Number of periods before treatment to include in the estimation (default 1)
**post** | Number of periods after treatment to include in the estimation (default 3)
**baseline** | Either a negative number between `-pre` and `-1` or `average`, or `atet`. If `-k`, the baseline is the kth period before the treatment. If `average`, the baseline is the average of the pre-treatment periods. If `atet`, the regression table reports the average of the post-treatment periods minus the average of the pre-treatment periods. Default is `-1`.
**graph** (optional) | Plot the event study graph with the default settings of `hetdid_coefplot`.
**generate** (optional) | Name of the frame to store the coefficients and their confidence interval.

# Background
`xthdidregress` returns ATET between `t` and `t-1` whenever `t` is before the treatment. That is, pretrends are reported as first differences, whereas actual treatment effects are reported as difference relative to the period before treatment. This can lead to misleading event study plots (Roth 2024a). The `eventbaseline` command transforms the coefficients into a correct event study relative to a baseline.

# Remarks
The command can only be run after `xthdidregress`. 

The command also returns, as part of `e()`, the coefficients and standard errors. See `ereturn list` after running the command. Typical post-estimation commands can be used, such as `outreg2` or `estout`.

The reported number of observations is also corrected to exclude the treated periods outside the reported event window.

If the `generate` option is used, the returned frame contains the following variables:
- `time`: the time period relative to the baseline
- `coef`: the estimated coefficient
- `lower`: the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval
- `upper`: the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval

The frame is `tsset` by `time`, so `tsline` can be used to plot the event study.

# Examples
See `example.do` and `example.log` for a full example.

```
. use "df.dta"
. replace t = t + 100
. xtset i t
. xthdidregress ra (y) (d), group(i)
note: variable _did_cohort, containing cohort indicators formed by treatment
      variable d and group variable i, was added to the dataset.
